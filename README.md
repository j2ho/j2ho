## Hi there 👋

🌱 Worked/Working on exciting projects under: https://github.com/seoklab

🌱 Check out some of my public work: 
- Human Proteome Binding Site DB: https://galaxy.seoklab.org/hproteome-bsite/
- Virtual Screening Tool on KAIDD webserver: https://galaxy.seoklab.org/kaidd/docs

🔍 I believe that thoughtful dataset curation is just as important as model architecture. Datasets and related scripts are not included in the repositories, but they are the key to success of our methods!

⚡ Started actively committing projects to GitHub mainly this year (2025), so projects like GalaxySite2 are one-time backups. I've been working to polish those projects while developing new interesting work!
